Sometimes, we're asked to manipulate some of the data on the server side before we send responses back but we love it around these parts. Let's take a closer look.")

  //this will determine whether we trigger dialogue for two tier or three
  function howMuchData(total){

  // create a function that takes in an input regarding the type of data we're dealing with that begins dialogue about  
  //we will then create a function that triggers a function that returns a true or false value 
    //the returned boolean will determine whether the logic will sit on the server side or the client side
      //we will then need to trigger dialouge about:
      // thick client meaning procesing logic is sitting on client side (video editing software)
      // thin client meaning processing logic is sitting on the server side (streaming services like netflix) 
}

  // const choice = module.exports() // returns whatever our output is to the server
